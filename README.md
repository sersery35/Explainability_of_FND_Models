This repository aims to explain state-of-the-art Fake News Detection models.
Huggingface module is intended for explaining only-text-based fake news detection models in Transformers.
GNNFakeNews module is an attempt to explain GNNs for fake news detection (https://github.com/safe-graph/GNN-FakeNews) in
using
GNNExplainer (https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html#torch_geometric.nn.models.GNNExplainer)
and latent space exploration.

Note: All citations will be handled according to the requirements in each repository.
